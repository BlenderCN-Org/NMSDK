Prerequisites Blender NMSDK requires a version of blender greater than or equal to 2.79. This is due to the model importer component to need a shader node that only exists with Blender 2.79 and above. NMSDK has not been tested for blender 2.80, however it is likely to not work, and support for 2.80 will not come until 2.80 is out of beta and is the latest official release. MBINCompiler For NMSDK to work, it requires MBINCompiler to generate the .mbin files that are read by the game. The easiest way to have MBINCompiler set up is to download the most recent release and register MBINCompiler to the path so that it can be picked up anywhere by Blender. If you already have a version of MBINCompiler on your computer, ensure it is version 1.7.0.4 or above. This can be found on the MBINCompiler releases page.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#installing-nmsdk","text":"Put the files in the right place.","title":"Installing NMSDK"},{"location":"setup/#prerequisites","text":"","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"setup/#blender","text":"NMSDK requires a version of blender greater than or equal to 2.79.
